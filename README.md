**EduPlayCare** is an AI-powered, gamified platform designed for the non-invasive early detection of learning difficulty markers (e.g., dyscalculia, dyslexia, ADHD) in children, with a specific initial focus on those in hospitalized or clinical settings.

This repository serves as the foundational framework for the project, outlining the psychopedagogical methodology, the technical architecture, and the preliminary pilot case studies that inform its design.

Childhood hospitalization or clinical treatment creates a significant gap in educational and psychopedagogical assessment. Traditional diagnostic tools are often formal, anxiety-inducing, and ill-suited for a non-academic environment. This results in missed opportunities for early intervention.

My clinical experience as a psychopedagogue has shown that children (like "Hannah," my anonymized case study) possess immense potential that is often masked by the frustration of mismatched assessment tools.

<h2 style="color: #003876;">üí° 3. The Strategy Guide (The "EduPlayCare" Solution)</h2>

EduPlayCare transforms assessment into play. By embedding validated psychopedagogical assessment principles into engaging, RPG-style mini-games, the platform will:

* **Engage Players (Children):** Create a non-threatening environment based on retro RPG aesthetics.
* **Collect 'Loot' (Data):** Non-invasively gather gameplay data (response time, error patterns, hesitation markers).
* **Analyze & Identify:** Utilize a machine learning model to analyze these patterns and flag potential risk markers for clinicians.
* **Adapt (Dynamic Difficulty):** Employ "computer-based scaffolding" (inspired by the research of Prof. Kim Nam Ju at Yonsei) to adapt game difficulty in real-time.

<h2 style="color: #003876;">üó∫Ô∏è 4. Inventory & World Map (Repository Structure)</h2>

* **[üß† The 'Skill Tree' (Project Methodology)](METHODOLOGY.md):** Details the three core pillars of the project: Psychopedagogy, Gamification Design, and the AI Framework.
* **[üìú First 'Side Quest' (Pilot Case Study)](CASE_STUDY.md):** Presents an anonymized pilot study from my current clinical practice, which serves as the proof-of-concept.
