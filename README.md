## 1. Project Vision

**EduPlayCare** is a proposed AI-powered, gamified platform designed for the non-invasive early detection of learning difficulty markers (e.g., dyscalculia, dyslexia, ADHD) in children, with a specific initial focus on those in hospitalized or clinical settings.

This repository serves as the foundational framework for the project, outlining the psychopedagogical methodology, the technical architecture, and the preliminary pilot case studies that inform its design.

## 2. The Problem

Childhood hospitalization or clinical treatment creates a significant gap in educational and psychopedagogical assessment. Traditional diagnostic tools are often formal, anxiety-inducing, and ill-suited for a non-academic environment. This results in missed opportunities for early intervention, allowing learning difficulties to become more profound barriers to academic success.

My clinical experience as a psychopedagogue has shown that children with traits of neurodiversity (like "Hannah," my anonymized case study) possess immense potential that is often masked by the frustration of mismatched assessment tools.

## 3. The "EduPlayCare" Solution

EduPlayCare transforms assessment into play. By embedding validated psychopedagogical assessment principles into engaging, RPG-style mini-games, the platform will:

* **Engage Children:** Create a non-threatening environment where children interact naturally with challenges.
* **Collect Data:** Non-invasively gather gameplay data (e.g., response time, error patterns, hesitation markers, problem-solving strategies).
* **Analyze & Identify:** Utilize a machine learning model to analyze these patterns and flag potential risk markers for specific learning difficulties, providing a data-driven report for clinicians and educators.
* **Adapt:** Employ "computer-based scaffolding" (inspired by the research of Prof. Kim Nam Ju at Yonsei) to adapt game difficulty in real-time, maintaining engagement and providing support.

This project is directly inspired by the success of South Korean EdTech initiatives and hospital-based applications (like the "Safe Kids Hospital (SKH)" app).

## 4. Repository Structure

* **[METHODOLOGY.md](METHODOLOGY.md):** Details the three core pillars of the project: Psychopedagogical Foundation, Gamification Design, and the AI/Technical Framework.
* **[CASE_STUDY.md](CASE_STUDY.md):** Presents an anonymized pilot study from my current clinical practice, which serves as the proof-of-concept for the EduPlayCare methodology.
