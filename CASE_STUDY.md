# EduPlayCare: Pilot Case Study (Anonymized)

**Disclaimer:** All identifying information has been removed to protect patient confidentiality. This case study is drawn from my current clinical psychopedagogy practice and serves as the manual proof-of-concept for the EduPlayCare project.

## 1. Patient Profile

* **Identifier:** Patient A
* **Age:** 9
* **Presenting Profile:** Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (Level 1 Support) and traits consistent with Dyscalculia. Patient exhibits high intelligence in verbal and spatial reasoning but demonstrates extreme anxiety and frustration ("math phobia") when presented with traditional, abstract math problems.

## 2. Manual "Proto-EduPlayCare" Intervention

The objective was to assess mathematical reasoning without triggering math-related anxiety.

* **Method:** Instead of formal tests, I utilized digital logic-puzzle games (*Logiclike*, *Mathland*) as the primary assessment tool.
* **Manual "AI" Scaffolding:** I acted as the "adaptive algorithm." I observed the patient's gameplay and manually adjusted the difficulty.
    * When frustration was noted (e.g., verbal stimming, avoidance), I would offer a verbal "scaffold" (e.g., "What if we try organizing the blocks by color first?").
    * When a concept was mastered, I would introduce a more complex variable in the next game.
* **Data Collection:** I manually logged gameplay data:
    * Time to solve specific puzzle types.
    * Types of errors made (e.g., spatial reasoning vs. numerical calculation).
    * Response to scaffolding (e.g., "Patient successfully used the strategy on the next puzzle").

## 3. Preliminary Findings & Project Justification

* **Finding 1 (Engagement):** The gamified, non-abstract format entirely bypassed the patient's math phobia. The patient demonstrated high engagement and persistence for over 40 minutes, a task impossible with traditional worksheets.
* **Finding 2 (Data):** The patient demonstrated strong logical-mathematical reasoning skills when the numerical component was abstracted (e.g., using "mana potions" instead of "numbers"). Errors primarily occurred during "translation" back to abstract numerals.
* **Justification for "EduPlayCare":** This manual process is effective but not scalable. It proves that a gamified, adaptive system (like EduPlayCare) can successfully differentiate between a *skill deficit* (inability to reason) and a *performance barrier* (anxiety, phobia). The AI model would automate this "scaffolding" and data-logging process, allowing this powerful diagnostic approach to be used at scale.
